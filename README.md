# Computation of the marginal likelihood from MCMC output (*marglike*)

This repository will contain code to estimate the marginal likelihood, that is Pr(data|model), from the output of a MCMC sampler.

This technique has been proposed in Robert & Wraith (2009), and further developed in Acerbi et al. (2017).
